## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-21

The 0.2.0 release delivers the managed runtime, networking, and platform
support around Core. All six roadmap phases are complete; ESP32-S3 runtime
margins were measured on hardware in Phase 6.2.

- **Core actor-model retirement (Phase 1).** The duplicate Core
  `TWorld`/`TActor`/`FActorComponent`/`FNetwork` actor model is removed; the
  managed Engine (`UWorld`/`AActor`/`UActorComponent`) is the sole
  World/Actor/Component API and Core is lifecycle/tick primitives only
  (`FApplication`, `FTickFunction`, `FLifecycleGuard`, `FTickable`).
- **Runtime spawn/destroy (Phase 2).** `UWorld::SpawnActor`/`DestroyActor`
  queue at the call site and apply at one deferred `ApplyPending` barrier per
  frame (destroys before spawns); capacity counts live + pending; every
  rejection is transactional.
- **Composition root + logging (Phase 3).** `TEngineHost<...>` owns the class
  registry, object store, garbage collector, world, and timer manager behind
  one fixed 7-step per-frame order (PumpReceive → Timers.Advance →
  World.Advance → World.ApplyPending → Store.ApplyPendingDestroy → GC slice →
  PumpSend). `MW_LOG`/`MW_LOG_MSG` add a bounded logging facade with a
  compile-time level floor.
- **Networking with roles (Phase 4).** `TNetHost<MaxPeers, MaxPacketBytes>`
  runs `ENetMode` Standalone / Client / ListenServer / DedicatedServer over a
  bounded peer table, with Hello/Welcome admission, heartbeats, timeout
  eviction, generation-checked `FPeerId`, and channel-based send/receive
  (channel 0 reserved for control). Engine integrates net through an
  engine-owned `INetworkFrame` seam so production Engine stays net-free.
- **Real transports + platform adapters (Phase 5).** Two non-portable adapter
  packages, both excluded from `CheckDependencyBoundaries.py`: `microworld-platform-host`
  (`FHostUdpDriver`) and `microworld-platform-esp32` (`FEsp32TimeSource`,
  `FEsp32UdpDriver`, `FEsp32E32LoraDriver`, `Esp32LogSink`). The portable
  `Net/FrameCodec.h` (`TFrameDecoder`, `EncodeFrame`, CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE)
  provides the LoRa wire framing, host-tested off-target.
- **Two-node demo (Phase 6.1).**
  `lib/microworld-platform-host/examples/TwoNodeDemo` composes a
  dedicated-server `TEngineHost` and a bare `TNetHost` client over real
  localhost UDP in one deterministic interleaved loop.
- **Measured ESP32-S3 runtime margins (Phase 6.2).** On a connected ESP32-S3 @
  160 MHz (release `-Os`, image RAM 43,148 B / Flash 313,269 B), the
  representative world (8 actors / 16 components / 8 timers) measured: tick
  min 62 / mean 73 / max 114 µs; GC Advance-slice min 21 / mean 25 / max 39 µs
  (budget `{root=1,mark=1,sweep=8}`); no-traffic net pump mean 47 µs;
  world-setup heap 580 B; main-task stack 2,476 B free after setup. Recorded
  in `lib/microworld-platform-esp32/benchmarks/Results/Esp32S3N16R8.md`.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-18

Initial Core release:

- `FApplication`, `TWorld<N>`, `TActor<N>`, and `FActorComponent` provide
  bounded deterministic lifecycle dispatch.
- `FTickFunction` provides caller-time scheduling, saturation, independent
  tick configuration, and no catch-up bursts.
- CMake/CTest, PlatformIO consumer probes, host tests, a host example, and
  benchmark harnesses are included.

The release passed 31 host behavior cases, strict public-header and
no-exceptions/no-RTTI consumers, and recorded ESP32-S3 compile evidence. See
the [Core evidence records](benchmarks/Results) for exact toolchain and build
facts.
